Previously, to understand how #$ARGUMENTS worked, I asked you for markdown diagrams. Those were helpful, but I think we should take a different approach. Why don't we instead take on the roles of museum curator and visitor. I'll be the visitor and you'll take me on a slow, guided tour, of the application and just like a real museum tour, we'll take brief pauses where I can ask what questions I have at that part of the tour.
